\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Represents a single track within an audio project. 

A track consists of a sequence of {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{class_audio}{Audio}}} objects (clips or segments). It might also have track-\/specific properties like volume, pan, effects, etc. (though not all are explicitly defined in this version).

\begin{DoxyNote}{Note}
TODO\+: Consider whether {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{class_track}{Track}}} itself should also inherit from {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{class_audio}{Audio}}}. This would allow tracks to be treated as composite audio objects, which could be useful for sub-\/mixing or hierarchical project structures. 

TODO\+: Ensure that a {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{class_track}{Track}}} cannot contain another {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{class_track}{Track}}} directly if the design intends a flat list of audio clips per track. If hierarchical tracks are desired, this needs careful design. 
\end{DoxyNote}

Applies one or more audio effects to the track or its constituent audio clips. 

The specific effects and how they are applied (e.\+g., to individual clips, the entire track output, or as insert/send effects) would be defined in the implementation. This might involve iterating through audio clips and wrapping them with \mbox{\hyperlink{class_effect}{Effect}} objects, or applying effects during a mixing process. \begin{DoxyNote}{Note}
The implementation details (which effects, how they are configured, etc.) are not specified in this header.
